Financial Viability:

Bagel shops can achieve profit margins of 10%-20%, depending on pricing, ingredient quality, and operational efficiency. In high-traffic locations, annual revenues can exceed $500,000, with daily sales targets of approximately 2,400 bagels. 
The relatively low production cost of bagels (around $0.50 per unit) allows for flexible pricing strategies and robust profit margins  
Midtown Toronto’s population density and purchasing power support high sales volumes, particularly if the business targets peak times (mornings and lunch hours) and offers seasonal promotions. 
Additionally, pairing bagels with premium beverages such as coffee and tea can significantly boost per-ticket spending
